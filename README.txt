Deviations:
Josh: experienced issues when he added Firebase with Cocoapods due to complications in XCode Beta, Swift 3, and Cocoapods update. There was also an issue of git version control in which XCode considered files to be missing, but in reality they weren't. 

Jerry: Thereâ€™s a minor bug that deletes additional video when recording enters a new loop.

Jake: Had two projects, Algo exam, two homeworks and an essay due this week. So I was very busy!
